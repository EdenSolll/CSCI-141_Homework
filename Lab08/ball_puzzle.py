"""
This program solves a ball sorting puzzle.
The puzzle consists of three stacks of balls, each of which can hold balls of different colors.
The goal is to move all the balls from the first stack to their matching color stack.

The program uses a stack data structure to keep track of the balls in each stack and implements an algorithm to move the balls to their corresponding stacks.
The program also uses an animation module to visualize the moves made by the algorithm.

The program can be run by executing the main() function, which prompts the user to enter the initialization text for the game and then
solves the puzzle using the algorithm function. The program outputs the number of moves required to solve the puzzle and displays an animation of the moves made.
