"""
This module contains a program that solves a ball puzzle game. The game consists of three stacks of balls, each of which can hold balls of different colors. 
The objective of the game is to move all the balls from the first stack to the third stack while following certain rules. 
The rules are as follows:
2. Only the top element of a stack can be moved to another stack.
3. A red element can only be moved to an empty stack or on top of another red element.
4. A blue element can only be moved to an empty stack or on top of another blue element.
5. A green element can be moved to an empty stack or on top of any other element.

The program uses a stack data structure to keep track of the balls in each stack and implements an algorithm to move the balls
 from the first stack to the third stack while following the rules. The program also uses an animation module to visualize the moves made by the algorithm.

The program can be run by executing the main() function, which prompts the user to enter the initialization text for the game and then 
solves the puzzle using the algorithm function. The program outputs the number of moves required to solve the puzzle and displays an animation of the moves made.
