    This function reads a file, if a comma is not in line the program assumes it is a word and saves that word as the last used word then assigns it as a key inside
    of the words dictionary. If a comma is in the line the program assumes it is a year and a count then assigns the year as a key and the count as the value.
    Then the program assigns those key, value pairs to the last used word. Finally the programm merges a default dictionary with the words dictionary to account for any missing year data.
