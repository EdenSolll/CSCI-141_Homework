File: printedWords.py
Description:
    This program uses wordData.py to read a file and store the data in a dictionary of words with a value of a dictionary representing the use of the word by year as a dictionary.
    Then the program asks the user for a year and prints out the total count of printed words for that year.
    The program also displays a plot of the total count of printed words for each year.
