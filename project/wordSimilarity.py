Description:
    This program takes in a file of words and their usage each year and a word. It then calculates the cosine similarity of the given word to every word in the file.
    The top 5 most similar words are then returned.

    This function takes in a dictionary of words and a word. It converts the data of the word in the dictionary to a vector array. It then compares the vector
    array of the given word to every word in the dictionary. It does this by looping through all the words in the dictionary, converting them to a vector array,
    normalizing their data, calculating the dot product of the two vectors, and calculating the cosine between the two vectors, which is then stored in a dictionary
    relating words to their cosine similarity to the given word. The dictionary is then sorted by the cosine similarity, and the top 5 most similar words are returned.

    Args:
        words (dict[str, dict[int, int]]): A dictionary of words and their usage each year.
        word (str): The word to compare to the dictionary of words.

    Returns:
        list[str]: A list of the top 5 most similar words to the given word.
