Question 1:

[a ->] [b ->] -> [c rest] -> [d none]


Question 2:
size = 1 + size(node.next)
1 + (1 + size(node.next))
1 + (1 + size(node.next))
1 + (1 + (1 + size(node.next)))
1 + (1 + (1 + (1 + size(node.next))))
4

Question 3:
The issue with this code is that it is trying to mutate an immutable list
To solve the error you either have to create the link at once by doing
front = FrozenNode(10, 20)
or by using a mutable linked list

Question 4:
Return a list of all even nodes

Question 5:

#! /bin/bash
